### Writing Actions
Upfront - write actions before developing features to understand and gain a shared knowledge of the feature being implemented.
Divide - categorize actions based on the event source.
Many - actions are inexpensive to write, so the more actions you write, the better you express flows in your application.
Event-Driven - capture events not commands as you are separating the description of an event and the handling of that event.
Descriptive - provide context that are targeted to a unique event with more detailed information you can use to aid in debugging with the developer tools.
